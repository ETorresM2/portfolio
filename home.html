            <h1>Draco Malfoy</h1>
            <p>Draco Lucius[11] Malfoy (b. 5 June, 1980) was a British pure-blood wizard and the only son of Lucius and
                Narcissa Malfoy (n√©e Black). The son of a Death Eater, Draco was raised to strongly believe in the
                importance of blood purity. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1991-1998 and
                was sorted into Slytherin House. During his years at Hogwarts, he became friends with Vincent Crabbe,
                Gregory Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and other fellow Slytherins, but he quickly developed a rivalry with
                Harry Potter.
                <br>
                <br>
                He was made a prefect of his house and was a member of the Inquisitorial Squad during his fifth year, at
                the end of which his father was imprisoned in Azkaban following the Battle of the Department of
                Mysteries. Lord Voldemort charged Draco with making up for Lucius's failure, and he became a Death Eater
                at age sixteen, but was quickly disillusioned with the lifestyle. Draco was unable to complete his task
                of murdering Albus Dumbledore, which was later taken over by Severus Snape, and only performed his other
                duties fearfully and reluctantly. He and his family defected hours before the end of the Second
                Wizarding War, fearing for their lives.
                <br>
                <br>
                By 2017, Draco had married Astoria Greengrass and had one child, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy.</p>
